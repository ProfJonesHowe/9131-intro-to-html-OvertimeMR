	<H2>Why Mangos are the best, and some history</H2>
	<p>Mangoes are the best fruit because they hit every note at once-lush, sweet-tart, wildly fragrant, and silky enough to eat with a spoon, yet sturdy enough to cube for salsa or blend into lassi and smoothies.</p>
	 <p>They are nutrition powerhouses too, rich in vitamin C, vitamin A, fiber, and polyphenols like mangiferin. Their story stretches back over 4,000 years to the Indian subcontinent, where they were celebrated in Sanskrit poetry and nicknamed the "king of fruits." From there, traders and monks spread mangoes across Southeast Asia, and Portuguese sailors carried them to Africa and the Americas in the 1500s: even the word "mango" traces to the Tamil "mangai" via Portuguese "manga." Today they are cultural iconsâ€”India and Pakistan's national fruit, Bangladesh's national tree and culinary chameleons that shine in chutney, tacos, sticky rice, and straight from the peel. In short: unmatched flavor, versatility, and history in one golden package.</p>
